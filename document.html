This API allows you to:

- Retrieve a specific item. And retreive all items.
- Update values of an item. (Not working)
- Delete one item with a specific id

To fulfill the CRUD concept we should have allowed two more types of functionality: one for creating new items, 
and one for updating existing values of an item. Which we did, but the code didnt work as expected. Therefore, have we listed them below.

1 ***
Update content of existing item
Description: You sould pass the item´s id and the values you want to change to.

Endpoint: /insert/:id, value1, value2, value3, value4, vlaue5
HTTP Methods: Put

2***
