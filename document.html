CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete):
1. to add data for a new product item (Create),
2. to list the data of a specific item (Retrieve),
3. to change data of a specific item (Update), and
4. to remove data of a specific item (Delete)

In SQL:
1. INSERT one or more rows
2. SELECT all items that meet some criteria. for example: "SELECT * FROM table" or "SELECT WHERE"
3. UPDATE the data in a row
4. DELETE rows from a table

Activities in our js file => SQL methods (Maybe change this to the SQL commands above):
1. Create table with content => POST or maybe GET(?)
2. Retrieve all the content from db => GET *
3. Update table based on user input => POST item from user input
4. Delete all content when hitting submit button => DELETE *



Starting with passing a GET request to reach the content of the table.
