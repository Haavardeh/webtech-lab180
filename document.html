CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete):
1. to add data for a new product item (Create),
2. to list the data of a specific item (Retrieve),
3. to change data of a specific item (Update), and
4. to remove data of a specific item (Delete)

In SQL:
1. INSERT one or more rows
2. SELECT all items that meet some criteria. for example: "SELECT * FROM table" or "SELECT WHERE"
3. UPDATE the data in a row
4. DELETE rows from a table

Activities in our js file => SQL methods (Maybe change this to the SQL commands above):
1. Create table with content => POST or maybe GET(?)
2. Retrieve all the content from db => GET *
3. Update table based on user input => POST item from user input
4. Delete all content when hitting submit button => DELETE *

API Assignment 3
In this API we offer functionality according to CRUD. The API offers methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources.

This API allows you to:
- Create a table with one item that can be updated later with more items. (Not sure if you can update table yet)
- Retrieve a specific item. And retreive all items.
- Update parameter of 
- Delete one specific item chosen by its id.

Delete specific item
Description: Removes a specific item with a given ID.
Endpoint: /remove/:id
HTTP Methods: POST
 
Delete all items (Not sure if we should have this)
Description: Removes all items from database
Endpoint: /remove
HTTP Methods: POST
 
Select a specific item 
Description: 
Endpoint:
HTTP Methods: 
 
Retrieve resource from specific ID
Description: Pass the item's ID as an argument to recieve all content from that item.
Endpoint: /retrieve/: id
HTTP Methods: GET
 
Retrieve all resources
Description: Give you all information about all the items.
Endpoint: /
HTTP Methods: GET


To really fulfill the CRUD concept we should have allowed two more methods: one for creating new items for the table, 
and one for updating existing data in the table. Which we did, but the code didnt work as expected. Therefor we list them below the working methods.
