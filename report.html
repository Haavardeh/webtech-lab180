  <h3> Introduction </h3>

  <h3> Accessibility highlights </h3>
  <p> The colors of our webpage consists of grey, white, and black tones. These might be conflicting with WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of colors) and 1.4.3 (Contrast). We did use a contrast ratio.
      The background image had two different colors, but the most dominant one was a lighter gray (#E8E8E9). We got a score of 17.15 on the contrast ratio when we compared the background color with black.
      It is said that 17.15 “Passes AAA level for any size text and AA for user interface components and graphical objects” <a href="https://contrast-ratio.com/#black-on-%23E8E8E9" target="_blank"> (source)</a>.
      Furthermore, the link in the footer is colored blue, while the background of the footer is colored as a darker blue which might cause concerns due to the 1.4.3 contrast principle. Since most of the text is smaller than 18px no-bold, there has to be a contrast ratio of 4.5:1. If the contrast is lower than the recommendations from WCAG 2.0, users with lower color perception might struggle to read the content. We used the contrast ratio, and as we thought it got a low score of 3.27, which is not quite appropriate. <br><br>

      There were several principles focusing on audio content, and images of text which both are irrelevant for our webpage since it does not contain such type of content. <br><br>

      Another concern we had was with WCAG 1.4.4. Resize text, as we were not sure if the text on the website would be properly adjusted if we resized the website up to 200 percent.
      We did try it out and when we zoomed in, it did not lose any content or functionality.
      The design shifted to the design we had for smaller screens, and it was possible to perceive all the information that we had on the website without any problems.
  </p>

  <h3> Improvement plan </h3>
  <p> There were quite a few things that we could improve, but we did have to prioritize which improvement actions we wanted to work on. </p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Fix contrast between the mail link and the footer. High priority, because it is important that users are able to perceive the information on the website. Related to WCAG 1.4.3. This can be done in the CSS, and we can also use a contrast ratio to see what colors are good combinations for the users. </li>
    <li>Add HTML alt to all images on the website that describe the images. This makes it better for screen readers. Related to WCAG 1.1.1.</li>
    <li>Fix the nav links so it serves some functionality. This will be done in the HTML file, and this enhances the usability, since the navigation bar will actually work. </li>
    <li>Run the validators for both HTML and CSS without any errors. This will need improvement in both HTML and CSS to avoid any errors in the code.</li>
  </ul>
